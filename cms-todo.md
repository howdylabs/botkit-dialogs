x proper trigger management
x ears need to be able to be callable by type
-> triggers should have access to stored user variables!
-> and if that is possible, why ever do it the current way hearing does? we know what test type it is

* script specific trigger view dialog
* sidebar search thinger
  -> should be "related scripts"
* script/thread update references thing
  * in local
  * in db
x finish ui for gotothread
* prevent from overwriting someone's changes
* mark dirty / x prevent navigate
* edit conditional should wait til you save to update model
* add script/thread from Gotothread / execute
* ability to provide a dropdown of options on the right side of a condition (IE list of intents)

* platform attachments - both editing and rendering


* import
* export
* import and translate from v1 to v2

* multiple actions in a block??
* negations??
* watch for loops and prevent infinite loops?
* ability to not store user response in a var?

x generate backlinks in header
  x triggers
  x gotos
